Tech writing guidelines

<section class="full-toc">

## Overview

- People using documentation have a right
  - to find what they neeed
  - and not to work hard at understanding what they are reading;
- on the other hand, it's a 2-way street, technical writers can reasonably expect good will on the part of the reader

- Documentation should communicate

- It's a combination of a certain level of concentration (good will) by the reader and a well-organized, well-written, and through documentation

## What can we reasonably expect (require) from the reader?

- What are the obligations of the reader?

- Good will

- Willingness to (sometimes) read a sentence more than once
  - but this requires that our writing style is easy to read - that the second reading is done only because the reader is reading something they didn't know beforehand, or the subject is inherently complex and requires some thought, or the point being made is so important that the writing indicates that the reader should remember or do this

- Some hands-on efforts at copying code, seeing how things work
  - But this requires that we have easy to do tutorials and how-tos

## Documentation Principles

### Relevant to every reader

The Docs must be readable / useable by everyone who starts reading / using it.

Who comes to the docs?
  - non-technical people
  - junior-level beginners to the subject
  - senior-level beginners to the subject
  - experienced with the subject
  - non-anglaphones
  - people in a rush
  - people who have time to read

### Complete / thorough

- Every subject treated is covered completely - no aspect of a treated subject is not discussed
- Every subject necessary for the overall subject of the documentation is treated
- Every way of seeing that subject is covered
  - use case
  - reference
  - non-technical
  - technical

### Clear and Unambiguous

#### Sentences
- Sentences should be simple, straightfoward
- Sentences should generally have only one idea, purpose, and meaning; but it is acceptable to add implications, such as the importance of the subject, whether it is recommended or not, if it is dangerous, serious, the potential impacts

#### Word-choice
- Word-choice must be simple, well-defined, universally understood, consistent throughout

#### Paragraphs
- Paragraphs should be short and contain a single subject or a single aspect of a larger subject, and it should have a clear beginning and end

#### Pages
- Should be self-contained
- Should be focused on one purpose - to treat a full subject, to teach someone how to do something, explain a concept
- Should not do too much
- Should know its purpose, stick to it, and should know the limits of how much to include and whether the page needs to be divided into 2 or more

#### Sections
- Should be limited if not removed all together

### Not Disjointed

- Content should be well-organized
- Information should not be scattered across too many different pages
- A single page should have a clear purpose and achieve that purpose without requiring a user to go elsewhere

- Acronyms

## Styling Guidelines

- Examples
  - All pages with examples should start with the most simple before getting more complex

- Bullet points
  - periods or not?

- hyperlink styling
  - punctuation as part of the link or not?

- Bolding
  - For what purpose
  - should be consistant
  - punctionation inside?

- "Reader" or "User" of the docs?
  - Do we read or use the docs?

- Sidebar on the left side?

- Sidebar on the right side

- Menu at the top

- Hover over

- Hide/show divs
