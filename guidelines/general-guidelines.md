### Pages

- Should be self-contained
- Should be focused on one purpose - to treat a full subject, to teach someone how to do something, explain a concept

- Information should not be scattered across too many different pages
- A single page should have a clear purpose and achieve that purpose without requiring a user to go elsewhere
