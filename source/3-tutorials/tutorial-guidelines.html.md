# Tutorial Writing Guidelines

## Structure

## General writing guidelines

## Assumptions, Prerequisites & Knowledge level

### Assumptions: 
Every tutorial starts from with certain assumption what a reader knows / wants to learn / tools that are available. 
Try to make these assumptions clear, but do not state the obvious: 

* use a clear title

### Toolset/Prereqs: 
What is the goal of the tutorial? Anything that is not the goal must be done **before** as to not break the flow of the tutorial. Put sucht things in front of the actual tutorial. 

Use: 

- list / checklist
- directly link to tool websites

### Knowledge Level: 
If you presume a certain level of knowledge you should mention this before the user starts. Nothing is worse than to start but not be able to finish. 

## Code

## Mixed media

## Words to avoid
